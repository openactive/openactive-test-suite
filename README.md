# OpenActive Test Suite ![Reference Implementation](https://github.com/openactive/openactive-test-suite/workflows/Reference%20Implementation/badge.svg)

To join the conversation, we're on the [OpenActive Slack](https://slack.openactive.io/) at #openactive-test-suite.

The general aim of this project is to allow end to end testing of the various flows and failure states of the Open Booking API.

This repository hosts two different projects:
* [Broker microservice](./packages/openactive-broker-microservice/): this sits in between the test suite and the target Open Booking API implementation. This allows the test suite to watch for changes, and throws them back to it.
* [Integration tests](./packages/openactive-integration-tests): this performs automated tests against the API

[The Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) provides an overview of upcoming development milestones, and contributions are welcome.

# Usage

For more info, read the individual README.md within the package directories:
* [Broker microservice](./packages/openactive-broker-microservice/)
* [Integration tests](./packages/openactive-integration-tests/)

## Configuration
Before running, configure the test suite:
 - `packages/openactive-broker-microservice/config/default.json`
   - [More information](./packages/openactive-broker-microservice/#configuration)
 - `packages/openactive-integration-tests/config/test.json`
   - [More information](./packages/openactive-integration-tests/#configuration)

## Installation
 - `npm install`
 
This will install the dependencies needed for both packages.

For developers that are customising the installation, for use in e.g. Docker, the directory `./packages/test-interface-criteria` is a dependency, and so must be present during `npm install`.

## Running

The broker microservice must be running before the test suite is run.

### Broker microservice
```bash
cd packages/openactive-broker-microservice
npm run start
```

### Tests
```bash
cd packages/openactive-integration-tests
npm run test
```


## Continuous Integration

When `waitForHarvestCompletion` is set to `true` in `default.json`, the `openactive-integration-tests` will wait for the `openactive-broker-microservice` to be ready before it begins the test run.

This is useful for running both packages within a continuous integration environment, as shown below:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e # exit with nonzero exit code if anything fails

# Install dependencies
npm install --prefix packages/openactive-broker-microservice
npm install --prefix packages/openactive-integration-tests

# Start broker microservice in the background
npm start --prefix packages/openactive-broker-microservice &
pid=$!

# Kill broker microservice in case of error
trap 'err=$?; echo >&2 "Exiting on error $err"; kill $pid; exit $err' ERR

# Run tests
npm test --prefix packages/openactive-integration-tests

# Kill broker microservice on success
kill $pid
```
