## Reference Implementation

The OpenActive Test Suite is developed against a reference implementation, [OpenActive.Server.NET](https://github.com/openactive/OpenActive.Server.NET/).

The CI checks that the Test Suite passes for the reference implementation. Therefore, the approach for adding each new test is to work on both:

- Reference Implementation: The implementation of the feature that's being tested.
- Test Suite: The test itself.

Any new feature must be developed in a `feature/*` branch in both reposities, in order for the CI to automatically run both feature branches against each other.

## Pull Request Process

Changes should be made by starting a new branch (from `master`), writing the changes in that branch and then submitting a Pull Request to rebase that branch into `master`.

For new features, use a `feature/*` branch in this repository that matches a `feature/*` branch in [OpenActive.Server.NET](https://github.com/openactive/OpenActive.Server.NET/). The OpenActive.Server.NET CI will use the tests in the test-suite branch to test the server's changes.

1. Every Pull Request should solve or partially solve an existing GitHub issue.
2. For changes to the `openactive-integration-tests` package, run the documentation generator, by running `npm run doc-gen --prefix packages/openactive-integration-tests`.
3. Ensure that documentation reflects the new changes.
4. Check that CI tests pass before merging a Pull Request.
5. Ensure that your Pull Request has at least one approval before merging.
