# prepayment required and unavailable (prepayment-required-unavailable)

Booking systems that allow BOTH prepayment required and prepayment unavailable

This feature must be implemented if prepayment-required and prepayment-unavailable are both implemented.

https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/#booking-without-payment

Coverage Status: **complete**
### Test prerequisites
Opportunities that match the following criteria must exist in the booking system (for each configured `bookableOpportunityTypesInScope`) for the configured primary Seller in order to use `useRandomOpportunities: true`. Alternatively the following `testOpportunityCriteria` values must be supported by the [test interface](https://openactive.io/test-interface/) of the booking system for `useRandomOpportunities: false`.
