# Common error conditions (common-error-conditions)

Tests C1, C2 and B for common error conditions applicable to all implementations


https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/#error-model

Coverage Status: **complete**
### Test prerequisites
Opportunities that match the following criteria must exist in the booking system (for each configured `bookableOpportunityTypesInScope`) for the configured primary Seller in order to use `useRandomOpportunities: true`. Alternatively the following `testOpportunityCriteria` values must be supported by the [test interface](https://openactive.io/test-interface/) of the booking system for `useRandomOpportunities: false`.

[TestOpportunityBookable](https://openactive.io/test-interface#TestOpportunityBookable) x29, [TestOpportunityBookableInPast](https://openactive.io/test-interface#TestOpportunityBookableInPast) x3


### Running tests for only this feature

```bash
npm start -- --runInBand test/features/core/common-error-conditions/
```
