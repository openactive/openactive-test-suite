### Test prerequisites
Opportunities that match the following criteria must exist in the booking system (for each configured `bookableOpportunityTypesInScope`) for the configured primary Seller in order to use `useRandomOpportunities: true`. Alternatively the following `testOpportunityCriteria` values must be supported by the [test interface](https://openactive.io/test-interface/) of the booking system for `useRandomOpportunities: false`.

[TestOpportunityBookable](https://openactive.io/test-interface#TestOpportunityBookable) x5, [TestOpportunityBookableNoSpaces](https://openactive.io/test-interface#TestOpportunityBookableNoSpaces) x3


### Running tests for only this feature

```bash
npm start -- --runInBand test/features/core/availability-check/
```



## 'Implemented' tests

This feature is **required** by the Open Booking API specification, and so must always be set to `true` by `default.json` within `packages/openactive-integration-tests/config/`:

```json
"implementedFeatures": {
  ...
  "availability-check": true,
  ...
}
```

| Identifier | Name | Description | Prerequisites per Opportunity Type |
|------------|------|-------------|---------------|
| [availability-confirmed](./implemented/availability-confirmed-test.js) | Occupancy in C1 and C2 matches feed | Runs C1 and C2 for a known opportunity from the feed, and compares the results to those attained from the feed. | [TestOpportunityBookable](https://openactive.io/test-interface#TestOpportunityBookable) x4 |
| [opportunity-full](./implemented/opportunity-full-test.js) | OpportunityIsFullError returned for full OrderItems | An availability check against a session filled to capacity. As no more capacity is available it is no-longer possible to obtain quotes. | [TestOpportunityBookableNoSpaces](https://openactive.io/test-interface#TestOpportunityBookableNoSpaces) x3, [TestOpportunityBookable](https://openactive.io/test-interface#TestOpportunityBookable) x1 |
