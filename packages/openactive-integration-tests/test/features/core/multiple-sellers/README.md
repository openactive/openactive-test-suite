# Multiple Sellers (multiple-sellers)

The booking system is multi-tenanted and provides services to multiple sellers.

It is not possible for Opportunities from different Sellers to be combined in the same Order.

https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/#booking-pre-conditions

Coverage Status: **partial**
### Test prerequisites
Opportunities that match the following criteria must exist in the booking system (for each configured `bookableOpportunityTypesInScope`) for the configured primary Seller in order to use `useRandomOpportunities: true`. Alternatively the following `testOpportunityCriteria` values must be supported by the [test interface](https://openactive.io/test-interface/) of the booking system for `useRandomOpportunities: false`.
