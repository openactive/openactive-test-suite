Allows the basket to be updated for a particular order


https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/#amending-the-orderquote-before-b

Coverage Status: **partial**
### Test prerequisites
Opportunities that match the following criteria must exist in the booking system (for each configured `bookableOpportunityTypesInScope`) for the configured primary Seller in order to use `useRandomOpportunities: true`. Alternatively the following `testOpportunityCriteria` values must be supported by the [test interface](https://openactive.io/test-interface/) of the booking system for `useRandomOpportunities: false`.
