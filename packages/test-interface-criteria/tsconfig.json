/* This tsconfig.json is used to check the types of all files in this library.
There is another, tsconfig.gen.json, which is used to emit .d.ts files for
clients of this library. These have to be separate because we cannot emit .d.ts
files for unit tests.
This one is the base because it encourages IDEs like VSCode to use it and thus
properly engage in type checking across all files. */
