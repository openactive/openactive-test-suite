# openactive-broker-microservice

This Node.js microservice provides a service to harvest data and proxy calls to an Open Booking API

## Usage
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Configuration

The `./config/default.json` file configures access to the Open Booking API.

### `datasetSiteUrl`

The URL of the dataset site of the booking system under test. This dataset site is used to configure the test suite.

```json
  "datasetSiteUrl": "https://openactive-reference-implementation.azurewebsites.net/openactive",
```

Please note the JSON within the dataset site must include the dataset site [Open Booking API extension](https://github.com/openactive/dataset-api-discovery/issues/2), as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": "http://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  ...
  "accessService": {
    "@type": "WebAPI",
    "name": "Open Booking API",
    "description": "API that allows for seamless booking experiences to be created for sessions and facilities available from Better",
    "conformsTo": [
      "https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/"
    ],
    "documentation": "https://developer.openactive.io/go/open-booking-api",
    "endpointDescription": "https://www.openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/swagger.json",
    "endpointURL": "https://example.bookingsystem.com/api/openbooking/",
    "landingPage": "https://exampleforms.com/get-me-an-api-access-key",
    "termsOfService": "https://example.bookingsystem.com/terms"
  }
}
```

Note that the `endpointURL` is most important, and must refer to your local Open Booking API [Base URI](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/#dfn-base-uri).

### `requestLogging`

Makes the output in the terminal more verbose. Useful for debugging.

```json
  "requestLogging": false,
```


### `waitForHarvestCompletion`

If `true` will block the `openactive-integration-tests` starting until the last page of each harvested feed is reached. This is useful for continuous integration environments.

```json
  "waitForHarvestCompletion": true,
```


### `ordersFeedRequestHeaders`

The headers used when accessing the Orders Feed, useful to configure authentication. Note such authentication [must not be specific to any particular seller](https://openactive.io/open-booking-api/EditorsDraft/#authentication).

```json
  "ordersFeedRequestHeaders": {
    "X-OpenActive-Test-Client-Id": "test"
  }
```

### `opportunityFeedRequestHeaders`

For private test environments with opportunity feeds that require authentication, headers may be configured. Note that in order to be considered "OpenActive Enabled" and to conform to the Open Booking API, such headers must not be required in production.

```json
  "opportunityFeedRequestHeaders": {
    "X-Api-Key": "example-api-key"
  }
```

### `datasetDistributionOverride`

For test environments that do not yet include a Dataset Site, data feeds may be manually configured. Note that in order to be considered "OpenActive Enabled" and to conform to the Open Booking API, a Dataset Site must be made available in production.

```json
  "datasetDistributionOverride": [
    {
      "@type": "DataDownload",
      "additionalType": "https://openactive.io/ScheduledSession",
      "contentUrl": "https://api.example.com/feeds/scheduled-sessions"
    },
    {
      "@type": "DataDownload",
      "additionalType": "https://openactive.io/SessionSeries",
      "contentUrl": "https://api.example.com/feeds/session-series"
    }
  ]
```

### `disableBucketAllocation`

When using the Broker Microservice as a tool to check validity of opportunity feeds that contain very large datasets, it can be desirable to limit memory usage by disabling bucket allocation. Note that bucket allocation must be enabled to run [Integration tests](../openactive-integration-tests/).

```json
  "disableBucketAllocation": true,
```

### `disableOrdersFeedHarvesting`

During development it may be desirable to temporarily disable harvesting of the Orders Feed. Note that tests that require the Orders Feed will fail when this is set to `true`.

```json
  "disableOrdersFeedHarvesting": true,
```

### `disableBrokerMicroserviceTimeout`

Opportunities are sorted into test-interface-criteria buckets based on the startDate of the opportunity when it is harvested. The means that the broker microservice must be restarted periodically to ensure its buckets allocation does not get stale. If bucket allocation becomes stale, tests will start to fail randomly.

This property must be set to allow the openactive-broker-microservice to run for more than 1 hour.

```json
  "disableBrokerMicroserviceTimeout": true,
```
