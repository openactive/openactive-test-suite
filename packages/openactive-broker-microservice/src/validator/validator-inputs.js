/**
 * Items are sent to the Validator Worker Pool (VWP) by saving them to files, which the VWP then reads and processes.
 *
 * The reason that they are sent as files, rather than, say maintained in memory, is so that there is a hard limit on
 * memory usage from queuing items to Validator.
 *
 * The potential worst case scenario is one in which Validator takes a long time to start the first time e.g. because
 * the OpenActive JSON-LD context is taking a long time to load.
 * If items are queued in memory, then, in this potential worst case scenario, the entire feed would be held in memory
 * waiting for validation.

/**
 * A chunk length of 100 gives a memory usage by Validator Workers of roughly up to 4kb * 100 * <NUM CORES>.
 *
 * - A rough average size of medium-size (e.g. SessionSeries rather than ScheduledSession) OpenActive items
 *   (uncompressed) is about 2-4kb.
 * - So, with 8 cores, the memory usage will be roughly up to 4kb * 100 * 8 = 3.2MB, which is acceptable.
 * - To clarify, this is the memory usage of just holding this data in memory. This is not counting the additional
 *   memory usage required by validator's mechanisms.
 *
 * The flipside is that this results in a number of validator-input files created that is roughly:
 *
 * - <NUM UPDATED ITEMS IN FEEDS> / 100
 * - This would happen if validator took so long to run that all the input files accumulated before it had run even
 *   once.
 * - So, with 1M items (as a very high example!) in the feeds, this could result in 10,000 files. This also seems
 *   acceptably unlikely to cause issues (e.g. inode usage issues).
